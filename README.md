# Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a timeless hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended). The game's simple rules dictate that rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
